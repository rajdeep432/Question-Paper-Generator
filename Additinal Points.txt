Database Integration:
Integrating a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to persistently store and retrieve questions. This allows for better scalability and persistence of data.

User Authentication:
Implementing user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can generate question papers. This could involve user accounts with roles and permissions.

Web API:
Converting to Web API. This would enable users to interact with the Question Paper Generator through HTTP requests, making it easier to integrate with other systems.

Logging:
Implementing a logging mechanism to record important events and errors. This helps in debugging and monitoring the application.

Error Handling:
Improving error handling by providing meaningful error messages and using appropriate HTTP status codes if your application is exposed as an API.

Unit Testing:
Unit tests for the functions to ensure that they behave as expected. Testing frameworks like Jest can be used for this purpose.

Scalability:
Designing to handle a large number of users and questions efficiently. Considering potential bottlenecks and optimizing where necessary.

Caching:
Introducing caching mechanisms to store frequently used data temporarily, improving performance.

Security Measures:
Implementing security measures, such as input validation and sanitation, to protect against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

User-Friendly Output:
Formatting the output in a user-friendly way. For example, instead of a plain array, structure the output as a JSON object with additional information.

Pagination:
Implementing pagination for retrieving questions from the database. This is essential for scenarios where there is a large number of questions.

Documentation:
Providing comprehensive documentation for the code and API, including how to set up the application, API endpoints, and any additional features.

Feedback Mechanism:
Implementing a mechanism for users to provide feedback on the generated question papers. This can help in improving the system over time.

Internationalization and Localization:
If applicable implementing internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) to make the application accessible to users from different regions.

Asynchronous Operations:
If certain operations, such as database queries, are time-consuming, consider making them asynchronous to avoid blocking the application.

By incorporating these enhancements, we create a more realistic, scalable, and secure Question Paper Generator that aligns better with real-world application development practices.
